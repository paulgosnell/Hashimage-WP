WordPress plugin for fetching images by Twitter hashtag.

This is just tested on my environment, but should be alright on any WordPress 3+ installation on PHP5 with libcurl.

It currently works with twitpic, instagram, yfrog, plixi, flickr, adding more services is quite easy and can be done on request. URLâ€™s are being curled and cached for 10-12 minutes in using the standard WP_Cache.

The plugin, when enabled, exposes a template tag which you can add to your theme:

<?php
if(function_exists('hashimage')){
 echo '<ul>';
 echo hashimage('hashtag=unicorn&limit=5');
 echo '</ul>';
}
?>

Nice-to-haves (feel free to add this!):
- Create posts in a Custom Post Type so all images are saved locally
- Resizer. Maybe just timthumb.
- Meta box inside posts to allow hashtag to be set per post.
- Settings page (width/height/alt-tags/etc)
- json-feed, for async call to plugin
